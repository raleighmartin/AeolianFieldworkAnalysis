OVERVIEW
This folder contains data corresponding to Figure 2 in "Field measurements demonstrate distinct initiation and cessation thresholds governing aeolian sediment transport" by Raleigh L. Martin and Jasper F. Kok

DATA FILE DESCRIPTIONS
"ThresholdAnalysis_RawFlux.txt"
This file contains the raw saltation flux values from Wenglor sensors shown in Fig. 2a.
t = time [s]
n = total counts rate [1/s]

"ThresholdAnalysis_RawWind.txt"
This file contains the raw wind speed values from the sonic anemometer shown in Fig. 2d.
t = time [s]
u = horizontal wind speed [m/s]

"ThresholdAnalysis_IntervalAverageValues.txt"
This file contains the interval average saltation flux and wind speed values shown in Figs. 2b and 2e, respectively.
t = time [s]
n = 2-second interval-averaged counts rate [1/s]
u = 2-second interval-averaged horizontal wind speed [m/s]

"ThresholdAnalysis_ThresholdCalcs.txt"
This file contains the analysis interval calculations for saltation thresholds shown in Figs. 2c and 2f.
t = time (midpoint of interval) [s]
fQ = 60-second saltation activity []
uth = 60-second threshold wind speed (NaN=calculation undefined) [m/s]
